
all words are lower case - Mar 11, 2018 - based on feedback from user
jjdeprisco, all words now begin with a underscore. 

Apr 13, 2018 - Due to an incompatiable with some other libraries that use _dc as a variable (When using SPI connections) - I've made all the Words uppercase with a underscore in front of them.

For the Normal Chip 100+ Word Shield and LBT:

_AM  this is am not a.m. (As in "I am going to somewhere.")
A.M. is _AM_
P.M. is _PM_

Both COLOR (US version), and COLOUR (UK version) can be used.
