Some notes:

I've not test this branch yet - these changes were suggested by jjdeprisco for issue #2.

All words now begin with an underscore (_) IE:

_begin
_alert
_one
_two

_am is the word am like: "I am"
_am_ is for A.M. as in time.
and to be consistent
_pm_ is for P.M. as in time.
